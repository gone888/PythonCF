# Exercise-1.2

- For recipe I chose to use a dictionary as it made the most sense to store data in key value pairings, it also allows values to be of any data type and even tuples or another dictionary.

- For all_recipes I chose to use a list to store each of the recipe dictionaries because a list is sequential in nature and multiple recipes can be stored and modified as required.
